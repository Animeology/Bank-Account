# Bank-Account

A Console-App program that either creates a account or takes in a existing account into a text file with two items:
The password and the current balance

The program has 5 choices:
1. Deposit money
2. Withdraw money
3. Check current balance
4. Calculate Interest rate with current balance
5. Quit and exit the program

After the transaction is done, the balance will replace the balance in the file.

Each account will have its own file with the password and start the balance with $0.
